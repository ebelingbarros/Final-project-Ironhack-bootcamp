#### The demise of the statist power sector model

The statist model that had led to the substantial increase of Brazil's installed capacity at sustained economic growth rates from the 1950s to the 1980s was close to its exhaustion in the 1990s, mostly because of a longstanding fiscal and financial crisis (Ferreira, 2000, p. 189). One reason was a price containment policy implemented due to macroeconomic reasons and a subsidization policy of energy intensive industries. From 1975 onwards, real tariffs were falling steadily. In in 1990, the average tariff was only 63% of the value charged in 1970 (Barbosa et al., 1991, p. 148).  If until the mid-1970s, the power industry was expanding in equilibrium through a comfortable self-financing capacity, the tariff containment policy curtailed the real return on the electric companies’ investments, which fell from 11% in 1977 to around 4-5% in 1986 (Romeu and Franco, 1989, p. 198).

</p>

After 1975, however, investments well still growing. They increased from US$3.120 billion in 1970 to US$7.107 billion in 1980, fell in the early 1980s, to reach its highest value (US$8.66 billion) in 1987. During the 1970-1988 period, more than US$113 billion were invested in the electric power sector, which represented, on average, 9.1% of the country’s gross national capital formation. During the 1970-1990 period, the country’s installed capacity grew by 466.67%, equivalent to an average annual rate of 9.0% (Barbosa et al., 1991, p. 154).  

To make this expansion policy in a scenario of tariff contaiment, Brazil raised financial resources  abroad. The volume of sector financing doubled from 1974 to 1980 and increased by 270% until 1989 (Barbosa et al., 1991, p. 160). These loans led the sector’s debt to skyrocket. Initially, however, the loans raised from official institutions, such as the IBRD and the IDB, whose fixed interest rates and very long terms (about 25 years), were fully compatible with sectorial projects' maturation (Romeu and Franco, 1989, p. 182). As these debts were mostly short-term, when international interest rates rose, electric companies encountered substantial difficulties to complete their projects and to pay off debts (Lorenzo, 2001, p. 159).

</p>

Hence, towards the end of the 1980s and early 1990s, the capacity of the state and the Brazilian electricity sector to invest in infrastructure and to expand the electrical system was gradually exhausting, amidst a growingly chaotic financial outlook (Oliveira and Salomão, 2016, p. 42).  In 1995, Eletrobras's the state's electricity holding recorded losses of US$153 million (in 1995 currency) (Musacchio and Lazzarini, 2014, p. 213). After the investment boom from 1951 to 1980, when generation capacity grew at an average rate of 9.8% per year, this rate plunged to 4.1 between 1981 and 1993. This was less than consumption growth, which grew 4.1% per year during that period (Pinheiro, 2005, p. 53).  By then, there was some consensus that the federal government’s responsibility for electricity generation had been overstretched, as 59% of the country’s capacity was in federal hand (Mello, 1996, p. 10).  

#### Reforms and demise of the marked-based model 

In the mid-1990s, the Brazilian government changed its role in the generation and distribution of electricity. The reform's main aim was to allow the government to focus on its roles as a policymaker and regulator while creating conditions for the private sector to assume operations and investments. The liberla electric sector reforms in the United Kingdom and Chile were the blueprints for Brazil’s electric sector reforms. They provided the blueprints for Brazil’s institutional learning process in the quest to convert a state-oriented sector into one in which market forces also could operate. The foremost goal of the reforms was to attract private investors to the generation and distribution businesses. The reform, which was legally guided by the 1995 Electricity Services Law, foresaw creating a new legal and regulatory framework to alter the concession laws and natural monopolies' economic regulation and legislation to facilitate competition. It also entailed creating new trading arrangements covering bulk electricity sales and purchases, connection to networks of transmission and distribution, and planning and expansion mechanisms for the sector. Large consumers could buy their power directly from producers (Mendonça and Dahl, 1999, p. 77).

However, reforms were not conducive to a buildup of new generation capacit, as they led to a decline in investment. During President Cardoso’s administration, a policy guideline established that private entrepreneurs, and not the state, would ideally invest in new hydroelectric power plants (Bajay, 2004, p. 114). However, the reform has attracted investors to the more lucrative distribution segment but has failed in attracting new private investors to the industry’s generation segment (Mendonça and Dahl, 1999, p. 73).  This poor investor performance resulted in an increase in installed capacity of only 2.6 MW per year on average in the 1993-2001 period, considerably smaller than the yearly 3.5 to 4.0 MW that was estimated to be necessary to meet demand’s expansion. In the 1993-1999 period, consumption grew by around 4.6% per year, a period in which installed capacity increased only 3.1% per year (Bielschowski et al., 2002, p. 89).  Instead of expanding the system’s capacity, foreign investments had been used to purchase distribution utilities’ assets (Pinguelli Rosa, 2001, p. 10).

<p align="center">
  <img width="80%" height="80%" src="https://github.com/ebelingbarros/Final-project-Ironhack-bootcamp/blob/main/figures/rationing2.png">
</p>

In 2001, a rationing crisis struck the country. It was caused by a particularly bad rainy season from October 2000 to March 2001. In October 2001, the southeastern/center-eastern subsystem of Brazil reached an all-time low of stored energy - of 24,132 GWh – which could not be compensated by the other subsystems (ONS, 2020). The reservoir’s deficient water levels forced policymakers to adopt rationing measures and increase electricity generated by natural gas-fueled plants. It also led to the establishment of a quota system for consumers, which lasted from June 2001 to March 2002 (Canêdo-Pinheiro, Dutra, and Hernandez-Perez, 2011, p. 242). That year, Brazilian society was compelled to reduce 20% of its consumption to ensure continuous electricity supply (Goldemberg and Prado, 2003, p. 231).  Rationing measures have resulted in a substantial reduction in electricity consumption (-7.9%) and have left several utilities deeply indebted (Barbosa and Francato, 2004, p. 3).  The level of reservoirs was already declining year by year because of a lack of investments in energy production and transmission in a context of increased consumption (Pinguelli Rosa, 2002, p. 131).   

#### The counter-reform and the auctioning system

The 2001 energy rationing crisis had dramatically exposed the shortcomings and negative results of the market-based electricity model of the 1990s. A diagnostic was reached that the market was incapable of allocating sufficient finance for the very capital-intensive power projects that were needed (Born, 2019, p. 21). In 2003, Brazil introduced a new regulatory model that altered the relationship between the State and private investors in the electric sector. The revised model reestablished long-term planning techniques and stronger policy guidance by the state (Oliveira, 2007, p. 58). The privatization drive, one cornerstone of the previous administration’s energy policy, was discontinued (Basso, 2019, pp. 7-8), to be replaced not by a model in which the government not necessarily owns the plants, but in which it regulates and plans the sector’s expansion.

The sectoral reforms move away from the market-oriented model of the 1990s and by setting up two trade environments, a free market and a regulated one. In the free market, free consumers could purchase their power from generators either through bilateral contracts or in the spot market (Losekann, Oliveira, and Silveira, 2011, pp. 655-655). In the regulated environment, which aims to supply power to captive consumers of distribution utilities, new power plants' contraction occurs in public electricity auctions, carried out in regulated terms (IEA, 2013, p. 311). The auctioning system for the concession of new plants and transmission facilities was implemented because the grid’s expansion requires a robust project finance system. In practice, the regulated market was the sole channel for financing new generation projects that added to the system’s capacity (Born, 2019, p. 21).  

In summary, with the reforms, as Bajay (2006, p. 865) argues, the government was attempting to integrate competition and planning, which prompted the creation of a “mixed institutional model.”  Through this revision of the market-based model that had been implemented during the 1990s, the result was a "hybrid power model," in which the new strategy for a market that is mostly owned and run by private investors underlined the Brazilian state's regulatory role (Bradshaw, 2017, p. 158). The new hybrid model emerges because, although the state had to regain its directive role and that of a financier, it was also essential to harness market forces, mainly because the financial crisis of the 1980s and 1990s had reduced the state’s degree of freedom to carry the burden of all the investments necessary for the system's expansion. In this new hybrid model, thus, private investment could be successfully stimulated, with strong participation by the state both as a financial partner (through state companies or pension funds) and through its financing mechanisms, for example, through the BNDES (Born, 2019, p. 22). 

<p align="center">
  <img width="80%" height="80%" src="https://github.com/ebelingbarros/Final-project-Ironhack-bootcamp/blob/main/figures/energy.png">
</p>

In the freshly introduced new auctions, there were different contracting mechanisms for power plants that already generated energy and new ones (Fishlow, 2013, p. 31). Auctions started being organized both for the generation of existing plants and new plants, whose capacity would be built after the auction. Since hydropower stations have lower generation unit costs than both thermal power stations and other renewable sources – such as wind power or biomass – it was expected that lower winning bids in the former type of auction would lead to overall lower average prices. The first auctions for energy generated in existing plants were conducted in December 2004 (Bajay, 2006, p. 874).  

#### The auctioning system in the wind power sector

The first wind power exclusive auction took place in December 2009. It attracted many investors, both private and government-owned companies, thus contracting 13,000 MW of wind projects (Bradshaw, 2017, p. 161). While the starting auction’s price was US$$94.6/MWh, the final average price reached was US$74.3/MWh, which represents a discount of approximately 21% discount (La Rovere, Westin, and Wills, 2013, p. 147). Since 2009, around 20,000 MW of added capacity in these auctions was successfully contracted, as shown in Graph 2.17 below. 

<p align="center">
  <img width="80%" height="80%" src="https://github.com/ebelingbarros/Final-project-Ironhack-bootcamp/blob/main/figures/wind.png">
</p>

With this, Brazil’s wind energy grew from 93 MWh generated in 2005 to 55,986 GWh in 2019, accounting for around 8.9% of its electricity mix. In 2019, wind power was the second-fastest-growing energy source in the country (15.5%), only after solar power (92.1%) (EPE, 2020). Of the US$61.6 billion invested committed to investments in 43 auctions (in 21, there were bids for wind power projects) that have taken place from 2005 to 2019, around US$20.3 billion went to the wind power sector (ANEEL, 2020). Around 1 in every 4 of added capacity (MW) from the auctions comes from wind.  In 2018 Brazil reached the mark of 518 wind parks and over 6.600 wind turbines in operation. This has led to the creation of over 195 thousand jobs since wind power inception in Brazil, with a large concentration in the last eight years (ABEolica, 2018).  From 2008 onwards, wind energy projects were competitive, despite the absence of state subsidies (Viola and Franchini, p. 2017, p. 112).  The winning offers at recent energy auctions currently decline in price and achieve significant discounts on regulators' price ceiling. Since the early 2010s, Brazil's wind energy was among the lowest in the world at a level below the US$60/MWh mark (Silva et al. 2013, p. 694).  

#### Solar energy and the auctioning system

In recent years Brazilian authorities and the private sector have increasingly focused on solar energy development (Vale et al., 2017, p. 297).  ANEEL approved specific auctions for solar power plants in 2014. The first auction was held in 2014, and the second in 2015; 3047.6 MW of installed capacity was contracted in both auctions (Melo, Jannuzzi and Bajay, 2016, p. 228). Between 2012 and 2019, the Brazilian photovoltaic sector generated over 130 thousand jobs. In 2020, 120 thousand will be generated (ABSolar, 2020). The increase of distributed and centralized solar generating capacity in Brazil has been dramatic in the last years.  Another critical achievement of the auctions was that solar energy became the most competitive energy source of the auctions. There jas dramatic fall of the average price of solar proposed in auctions in the 2013-2019 period.
