#### Convert the necessary measures to dimensions (the variables that are categorical in nature)

In the early 1990s, the statist model that had sustained the impressive growth of the electricity sector from the 1950s to the 1980s was close to its exhaustion, mostly because of a longstanding fiscal and financial crisis (Ferreira, 2000, p. 189). From 1975 onwards, the government had limited tariff adjustments to inflation rates, such that real tariffs were falling steadily over the 1970s and 1980s. This policy experiment reflected a historic tendency by the state to use the electricity sector to attain macroeconomic objectives (Araújo and Besnosik, 1993, p. 9; Baer and McDonald, 1999, p. 23; Rosa, 2002, p. 119; Melo, Araújo and Oliveira, 1994, p. 248). While electricity generation installed capacity was increasing, demand had stabilized. Thus, the surplus was sold at very low prices to subsidize the replacement of fuel oil by other energy carriers, in the context of the II PND, which sought to replace imported sources of energy with domestic ones.  Subsidized energy was offered to aluminum manufacturers whose production was mostly oriented for exports. In a context where Brazil was facing a grave balance of payments problem because of the two petroleum shocks of the 1970s, that strategy aimed to make Brazil’s exports more competitive internationally.  
Thus, the electricity sector’s tariffs were on a downward trend since the mid-1970s, such that, in 1990, the average tariff was only 63% of the value charged in 1970 (Barbosa et al., 1991, p. 148).  If until the mid-1970s, the electricity industry was expanding in equilibrium through a comfortable self-financing capacity, the tariff containment policy curtailed the real return on the electric companies’ investments, which fell from 11% in 1977 to around 4-5% in 1986 (Romeu and Franco, 1989, p. 198). This led those companies’ share of self-financing in new projects to fall from 43% in 1974 to 27% in 1986 (ibid, p. 182). The 1988 Federal Constitution’s replacement of the IUEE by the ICMS further curtailed the sectoral investment capacity (Melo, Araújo, and Oliveira, p. 248). However, this was a period in which the electricity sector was growingly efficient over time, as shown in Graph 2.12 below. The pricing policy, in this sense, did not remunerate public electricity utilities for their efficiency gains.

Especially after the II PND, even though the state reduced the flow of financial resources to the sector, it continues pushing energy supply expansion to maintain the pace of economic growth. This led to the implementation of projects that did not have a very high economic return (Lorenzo, 2001, p. 86-8). Another interpretation is that these massive investments also reflected a temporary undemocratic political equilibrium, in which the state was servicing the interests of large contractors, which grew in size and benefitted considerably from a non-transparent cost financing model (Monteiro and Santos, 2010, pp. 60-61; Lorenzo, 2001, p. 86-8). Investments grew from US$3.120 billion in 1970 to US$7.107 billion in 1980, fell in the early 1980s, to reach its highest value (US$8.66 billion) in 1987. During the 1970-1988 period, more than US$113 billion were invested in the electric power sector, which represented, on average, 9.1% of the country’s gross national capital formation. During the 1970-1990 period, the country’s installed capacity grew by 466.67%, equivalent to an average annual rate of 9.0% (Barbosa et al., 1991, p. 154).  
Since the 1970s, the expansion of Brazil’s energy program growingly depended on financial resources raised abroad. In this sense, Mirow interprets that  International Electrical Association’s supplier cartels offered cheap loans to maintain Brazil as a loyal importing country (Mirow, 1979, p. 200). The volume of sector financing doubled from 1974 to 1980 and increased by 270% until 1989 (Barbosa et al., 1991, p. 160). These loans led the sector’s debt to skyrocket, as shown in Graph 2.13 below. Initially, however, the loans raised from official institutions, such as the IBRD and the IDB, whose fixed interest rates and very long terms (about 25 years), were fully compatible with sectorial projects' maturation (Romeu and Franco, 1989, p. 182). As these debts were mostly short-term, when international interest rates rose, electric companies encountered substantial difficulties to complete their projects and to pay off debts (Lorenzo, 2001, p. 159).

Hence, towards the end of the 1980s and early 1990s, the capacity of the state and the Brazilian electricity sector to invest in infrastructure and to expand the electrical system was gradually exhausting, amidst a growingly chaotic financial outlook (Rodrigues and Dias, 1994, p. 80; Oliveira and Salomão, 2016, p. 42; Hira, 2003, pp. 49-50).  During the early 1990s, Eletrobras, acting as the sectors’ holding, had to purchase – at a higher price – energy from other firms to meets its contractual obligations and also to rescue Furnas that owed it around US$630 million (in 1995 currency) for electricity purchases (Musacchio and Lazzarini, 2014, p. 213).  
For example, in 1995, Eletrobras recorded losses of US$153 million (in 1995 currency) (Musacchio and Lazzarini, 2014, p. 213; Baer and McDonald, 1999, p. 25). After the investment boom from 1951 to 1980, when generation capacity grew at an average rate of 9.8% per year, this rate plunged to 4.1 between 1981 and 1993. This was less than consumption growth, which grew 4.1% per year during that period (Pinheiro, 2005, p. 53).  By then, there was some consensus that the federal government’s responsibility for electricity generation had been overstretched, as 59% of the country’s capacity was in federal hand (Mello, 1996, p. 10).  

In the electricity sector, the reform’s results were much less animating. From the outset, the electric sector's institutional architecture had been frail. The first problem was that the privatization program, which started in 1995, predated the implementation of the market’s new regulation, mainly because the state used the sale of electric companies to pay its debts and to sustain a freshly implemented stabilization program (Pinguelli Rosa, 2002, p. 113). The sale of government-owned generation and distribution companies rose US$21 billion to service public debt (Bajay, 2006, p. 869). 
When ANEEL was eventually created, in 1996, problems with its implementation and the lack of experience and a regulatory tradition of Brazilian institutions created an unbalanced relation between private entrepreneurial agents and regulatory institutions. The result of an uncomplete process of policy experimentation with market instruments was that the groups that had acquired a participation in Brazil’s electric companies could pursue objectives bound to corporate interests, such as shareholder maximization, without having to pay attention to systemic objectives, such as carrying out the much-needed investments in installed capacity (Oliveira and Tolmasquim, 1999, pp. 102, 112). In these initial years of the reform, the electricity sector also lacked a planning authority since the CNPE was only set up in 2000 (Goldemberg and Prado, 2003, p. 229; Bajay, 2004, p. 114). For a certain period, Brazil’s electricity sector lacked strategic orientation and coordination. 
The second problem was that the BNDES was widely used to finance the privatization program (Ferreira, 2000, p. 209; Prates, Cintra, and Freitas, 2000, p. 93). It was believed that, after privatization, financial resources for investments in the sector would arrive through financial engineering and new financial instruments, such as project finance, private equity, leasing, joint venture, venture capital, and assets securitization (Cavalcante and Uderman, 2012, pp. 104-5). These novel financial instruments would step up private investors' share of investments and ease the state’s financial burden.  It was believed that, once electricity tariffs were readjusted, new projects would only need 30% of self-financing with these new financial instruments in place (Prates, Cintra, and Freitas, 2000, p. 93).
However, as there were still substantial regulatory uncertainties, the BNDES was called upon as a partner for risk mitigation in the investment decision. The bank used its finance to offer exchange rate hedge loans, devised to cover the entering companies’ accounting risk (Cavalcante and Uderman, 2012, p. 104; Pinto Jr, 1998, pp. 177-8). From 1995 to 2000, over 43.8% of total investments conducted by the newly privatized utility enterprises were financed by the BNDES (Musacchio and Lazzarini, 2014, p. 106). Besides acting as a hedger for own risk, BNDES also purchased equity from Eletrobras and some of its holding companies. These operations increased its stake in holding from 8% in 1995 to 19% in 1996 (Musacchio and Lazzarini, 2014, p. 213). Thus, although it was expected that a marked turn towards market-oriented financial mechanisms could be achieved, the state, more than ever, was required to make possible the market’s workings.  Because privatizations had not created the expected efficiency gains, this was not a virtuous combination of the market’s and the state's strengths.
Another problem, highlighted by Pinguelli Rosa (2002, p. 113), was that economists with a more market-based formation ignored Brazil's electric sector's specificities and technical complexity while designing the reforms. They reduced its problems to a purely financial problem that could be solved through the companies’ privatization or tariff increases. These economists ignored that Brazil’s mostly hydraulic energy park was, in fact, a competitive advantage, as generation cost did not depend on highly costly inputs such as fuels, that were set in international markets and could therefore oscillate heavily (ibid). In 2001, while Itaipu’s average cost was US$30/MWh and internally generated hydropower had a price of US$20 MWh, electricity produced with natural gas had a cost of US$40/MWh (Pinguelli Rosa, 2001, p. 8). In this context, Newbery (2004, p. 15) writes that:
“In contrast to almost all other countries, the long-run marginal cost of additional hydro investment is probably lower than that of combined cycle gas turbine (CCGT) plants. In addition, dispatching the dams gains from basin-wide coordination (…), while considerable rainfall fluctuations mean that it is advisable to maintain adequate water reserves. (…) These conditions are the least propitious for a competitive, privately-owned generation market. Investing in multi-use hydro-electric projects that need coordinated regulation creates considerable private investor risk. (…).  The uncomfortable conclusion is that it is unlikely that private ownership of generation is an efficient way to plan, develop, and finance the generation sector in Brazil.”  
Fiani similarly writes that privatization per se is not necessarily a solution. Before privatization is conducted, the degree to which the institutional and economic climate will optimize private investment and competitiveness benefits must be measured (2003, p. 50-1). However, although hydropower was an energy source that demanded efficient planning of generation capacity expansion, the sector’s deregulation and privatization during the 1990s led to the abandonment of planning (Rosa, 2001, p. 8).
Another major bottleneck of the reforms was that the new tariff policy did not induce efficiency gains. While the tariff system of the 1970s and 1980s almost led the system to collapse, the reforms of the 1990s, which permitted utilities to charge customers a realistic price that reflected the cost of generation, created a price distortion that did not compensate for generation investments (Mendonça and Dahl, 1999, p. 77). In 1995, immediately after the first concessions were handed over to private operators, a tariff rise ensued to make the assets that were to be privatized attractive for private investment (Azevedo and Serigati, 2015, p. 533). ). These tariff adjustments' primary beneficiaries were owners of freshly privatized distribution utilities, which were paying practically no attention to systemic efficiency. Because of economic and political lobbying, the competition was severely restrained amidst the privatization process (Rufin, 2003, p. 147). The result was concession contracts with generous terms and the curtailing of effective competition. A study by Ramos-Real et al. (2009, p. 298) using Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) finds that from 1998 to 2005, Brazilian electrical state utilities’ technical efficiency fell at a rate of -0.8% per year. The authors concluded that the reform process's incentives did not lead utilities to behave more efficiently.  The tariffs escalation and lack of efficiency gains led the system to detach itself from the logic of systemic competitiveness, as rising input prices favored the loss of competitiveness in the productive sector (Vieira, 2007, p. 190).  Because of more limited efficiency gains and higher prices, utilities were underperforming in their role as providers of both backward and forward linkages.
In that adverse scenario, as Mendonça and Dahl (1999, p. 79) explain, reforms were not conducive to a buildup of new generation capacity. As shown in Table 2.41 below, the reforms led to a decline in investment because, during President Cardoso’s administration, a policy guideline established that private entrepreneurs, and not the state, would ideally invest in new hydroelectric power plants (Bajay, 2004, p. 114). However, the reform has attracted investors to the more lucrative distribution segment but has failed in attracting new private investors to the industry’s generation segment (Mendonça and Dahl, 1999, p. 73).  This poor investor performance resulted in an increase in installed capacity of only 2.6 MW per year on average in the 1993-2001 period, considerably smaller than the yearly 3.5 to 4.0 MW that was estimated to be necessary to meet demand’s expansion. In the 1993-1999 period, consumption grew by around 4.6% per year, a period in which installed capacity increased only 3.1% per year (Bielschowski et al., 2002, p. 89).

By 2001, when a rationing crisis struck the country, it was clear that the electric sector's new institutional arrangement was unsustainable and that the previous path of policy experimentation with more market-oriented policy instruments had reached an impasse. The rationing crisis had been caused by a particularly bad rainy season from October 2000 to March 2001. In October 2001, the southeastern/center-eastern subsystem of Brazil reached an all-time low of stored energy - of 24,132 GWh – which could not be compensated by the other subsystems (ONS, 2020).  The level of reservoirs was already declining year by year because of a lack of investments in energy production and transmission in a context of increased consumption (Pinguelli Rosa, 2002, p. 131).  Instead of expanding the system’s capacity, foreign investments had been used to purchase distribution utilities’ assets (Pinguelli Rosa, 2001, p. 10).  
Other authors, such as Losekann, Oliveira, and Silveira (2011, p. 654), take the stance that the price produced by computer models were not enough to cover the costs of new generating capacity fully. The model produced contradicting results, such as unexplainable price volatility in a context of stable hydrology and demand; or low tariff values in low reservoir levels. Electric power generation projects important for balancing the market were postponed, and the stored energy, whose purpose was to be a buffer layer for the periods of critical imbalance, was depleted to avoid power shortage. One of the new model’s main flaws was that the computer model did not consider the consumer's decision to use more or less electric energy at the different moments of the day (Camargo, 2005, p. 9). Hence, a policy innovation that had been intended to simulate a feature from markets had markedly unperformed. 
The reservoir’s deficient water levels forced policymakers to adopt rationing measures and increase electricity generated by natural gas-fueled plants. It also led to the establishment of a quota system for consumers, which lasted from June 2001 to March 2002 (Canêdo-Pinheiro, Dutra, and Hernandez-Perez, 2011, p. 242). That year, Brazilian society was compelled to reduce 20% of its consumption to ensure continuous electricity supply (Goldemberg and Prado, 2003, p. 231; Esposito, 2018, p. 316).  Rationing measures have resulted in a substantial reduction in electricity consumption (-7.9%) and have left several utilities deeply indebted (Barbosa and Francato, 2004, p. 3). 
The 2001 energy rationing crisis dramatically exposed the shortcomings and negative results of the market-based electricity model of the 1990s. One of the most pressing public policy issues that the freshly empowered Lula da Silva (2003-2010) administration faced was the need to reform the electricity power sector’s regulatory model. The most critical issue that had to be addressed within the context of a counter-reform was how to fund the system’s expansion adequately, an ever-pressing necessity considering growing energy demand and faltering security of supply (IEA, 2013, p. 311). A diagnostic was reached that the market was incapable of allocating sufficient finance for the very capital-intensive power projects that were needed (Born, 2019, p. 21).
One proposal to reform the system was presented by Sauer et al. (2003, p. 13-162), who defended the return to planning and a more statist administration of the electricity system. In the author’s view, an essential premise for the functioning was that energy should be a cheap god, very much in the spirit of the Water code policy, of the 1930s (Branco, 1975; Branco, 2002), and in line with the idea that the energy had to be a cheap anti-commodity (Vieira, 2007) that provided the economy with both backward and forward linkages. For Sauer et al. (2002, p. 44), the electric sector, in particular the older hydro plants whose investments had been since long amortized, paid a “hydraulic rent” - that should be used in benefit of social and economic development, in close resemblance to the notion of a Hotelling rent. The failed mercantile system was transferring a monopolistic rent to foreign investors that little had added for the country’s economic wellbeing through the purchase of privatized utilities. As shown in Table 2.42 below, Sauer et al. (ibid) estimated that the entire system could produce a hydraulic rent of US$2.38 billion, which corresponded to about 4% of Brazil’s GDP in 2001.  Some of Sauer et al.’s (2002) ideas influenced the proposal of a new model for the electricity sector prepared by a Working Group at the Institute of Citizenship, an institution linked to the Workers' Party, which had risen to power in 2003 (Pinguelli, 2013, p.  173; D’Araújo, 2009, pp. 191-218).

Although the Institute of Citizenship’s proposal was not implemented, in 2003, Brazil introduced a new regulatory model that altered the relationship between the State and private investors in the electric sector. The new model’s introduction enabled the resumption of investments, which was regarded as a fundamental measure to reduce operational systemic risk, a policy issue that the 2001/2002 Power Supply Crisis had brought to the fold  (Basso, 2019, p. 7). The new model also aimed at maintaining tariffs low, reducing society’s perception of risk in this industry, providing investors a fair return, and providing grid connection to 13 million Brazilians who still lacked access to energy (Bajay, 2006, p. 871; Losekann, 2008, p. 91). To achieve these goals, the 2003/2005 revision of Brazil’s electricity sector established long-term planning techniques and stronger policy guidance by the state (Oliveira, 2007, p. 58). Since it was believed that large plants are conducive to low unitary costs, which are made possible by achieving economies of scale after the reforms, preference was once again given to large generation projects (Schaeffer et al., 2015, p. 30). With these measures, the government wants to reestablish the sector’s ability to provide both strong backward and forward linkages obtained, respectively, by constructing large plants that demand goods and services from Brazil’s manufacturing and civil construction sector and by providing cheap energy. The privatization drive, one cornerstone of the previous administration’s energy policy, was discontinued (Basso, 2019, pp. 7-8), to be replaced not by a model in which the government not necessarily owns the plants, but in which it regulates and plans the sector’s expansion.
The reintroduction of planning efforts led to the creation, in 2005, of the government company Empresa de Pesquisa Energética (EPE). EPE is a semiautonomous research and planning agency affiliated with the Ministry of Mining and Energy, which conducts the electricity sector’s long-term expansion (Hochstetler and Tranjan, 2016, p. 502). Its primary attribution is to perform 10- and 20-year expansion plans for the MME, a road plan containing commissioning schedules for hydropower and thermal plant projects, which identifies regional constraints and names the transmission lines required for the system’s safe expansion. In the revised model, while EPE and ONS became protagonists, ANEEL lost a share of its role in energy policy formulation (Pinguelli Rosa, 2013, p. 181).  As Fishlow writes:
 “ANEEL was a victim of the energy shortage afflicting Brazil in 2000-1 owing to decreased rainfall and a dysfunctional wholesale market. Management shifted back to the Casa Civil and executive decision-making. (..) This regulatory effort within Brazil recognizes that private decisions do not ensure a social optimum. Negotiation of specific rules and controls over private activity is an essential ingredient of modern democracy. Institutions are not immutable. There are also limits. They are imposed by the need to reconcile satisfactorily the variety of interests engaged: consumers and producers, domestic and foreign investors, developed and less developed regions, suppliers of inputs and outputs. What one sees in the recent Brazilian experience is an impressive learning process. Continuity and change are reconcilable” (Fishlow, 2013, p. 32). 
Brazil’s power market's counter-reform underscored Brazilian policymakers' ability to learn with the previous more market-based regulatory model's failures and experiment with policies that combined both states' and markets' strengths. In that vein, the sectoral reforms move away from the market-oriented model of the 1990s and by setting up two trade environments, a free market and a regulated one (Losekann, Oliveira, and Silveira, 2011, p. 654; Schirato, 2018, p. 134). In the free market, free consumers could buy power from generators either through bilateral contracts or in the spot market (Losekann, Oliveira, and Silveira, 2011, p. 655). In the regulated environment, which aims to supply power to captive consumers of distribution utilities, new power plants' contraction occurs in public electricity auctions, carried out in regulated terms (Schirato, 2018, p. 134; IEA, 2013, p. 311). The auctioning system for the concession of new plants and transmission facilities was implemented because the grid’s expansion requires a robust project finance system. In practice, the regulated market was the sole channel for financing new generation projects that added to the system’s capacity (Born, 2019, p. 21).  To serve captive consumers, distribution utilities would transact in a pool managed by a newly created entity, the Electric Power Trading Chamber (CCEE), to replace the electricity wholesale market organization, the MAE. The 2002/2003 reforms deepen a policy of unbundling formerly vertically integrated utilities to form separate generation, distribution, and trade activities with free consumers, to reduce the formerly vertically integrated companies’ market power (Santana and Oliveira, 1999, p. 382; Bajay, 2006, p. 872-3).
In summary, with the reforms, as Bajay (2006, p. 865) argues, the government was attempting to integrate competition and planning, which prompted the creation of a “mixed institutional model.”  Through this revision of the market-based model that had been implemented during the 1990s, the result was a "hybrid power model," in which the new strategy for a market that is mostly owned and run by private investors underlined the Brazilian state's regulatory role (Bradshaw, 2017, p. 158). The new hybrid model emerges from a learning process in which it was found that, although the state had to regain its directive role and that of a financier, it was also essential to harness market forces, mainly because the financial crisis of the 1980s and 1990s had reduced the state’s degree of freedom to carry the burden of all the investments necessary for the system's expansion. In this new hybrid model, thus, private investment could be successfully stimulated, with strong participation by the state both as a financial partner (through state companies or pension funds) and through its financing mechanisms, for example, through the BNDES (Born, 2019, p. 22). 
The auctioning system was aimed at resolving the problem of rising marginal costs in the generation segment. In these new auctions, there were different contracting mechanisms for power plants that already generated energy and new ones (Fishlow, 2013, p. 31). Auctions started being organized both for the generation of existing plants and new plants, whose capacity would be built after the auction. Since hydropower stations have lower generation unit costs than both thermal power stations and other renewable sources – such as wind power or biomass – it was expected that lower winning bids in the former type of auction would lead to overall lower average prices. The first auctions for energy generated in existing plants were conducted in December 2004 (Bajay, 2006, p. 874).  

The first wind power exclusive auction took place in December 2009. It attracted many investors, both private and government-owned companies, thus contracting 13,000 MW of wind projects (Bradshaw, 2017, p. 161). While the starting auction’s price was US$$94.6/MWh, the final average price reached was US$74.3/MWh, which represents a discount of approximately 21% discount (La Rovere, Westin, and Wills, 2013, p. 147). Since 2009, around 20,000 MW of added capacity in these auctions was successfully contracted, as shown in Graph 2.17 below.

With this, Brazil’s wind energy grew from 93 MWh generated in 2005 to 55,986 GWh in 2019, accounting for around 8.9% of its electricity mix. In 2019, wind power was the second-fastest-growing energy source in the country (15.5%), only after solar power (92.1%) (EPE, 2020). Of the US$61.6 billion invested committed to investments in 43 auctions (in 21, there were bids for wind power projects) that have taken place from 2005 to 2019, around US$20.3 billion went to the wind power sector (ANEEL, 2020). Around 1 in every 4 of added capacity (MW) from the auctions comes from wind.  In 2018 Brazil reached the mark of 518 wind parks and over 6.600 wind turbines in operation. This has led to the creation of over 195 thousand jobs since wind power inception in Brazil, with a large concentration in the last eight years (ABEolica, 2018).  From 2008 onwards, wind energy projects were competitive, despite the absence of state subsidies (Viola and Franchini, p. 2017, p. 112).  The winning offers at recent energy auctions currently decline in price and achieve significant discounts on regulators' price ceiling. Since the early 2010s, Brazil's wind energy was among the lowest in the world at a level below the US$60/MWh mark (Silva et al. 2013, p. 694).  

In recent years Brazilian authorities and the private sector have increasingly focused on solar energy development (Vale et al., 2017, p. 297).  ANEEL approved specific auctions for solar power plants in 2014. The first auction was held in 2014, and the second in 2015; 3047.6 MW of installed capacity was contracted in both auctions (Melo, Jannuzzi and Bajay, 2016, p. 228). Between 2012 and 2019, the Brazilian photovoltaic sector generated over 130 thousand jobs. In 2020, 120 thousand will be generated (ABSolar, 2020). As shown in Graph 3.5, the increase of distributed and centralized solar generating capacity in Brazil has been dramatic in the last years.  Another critical achievement of the auctions was that solar energy became the most competitive energy source of the auctions. Graph 3.5 below portrays the dramatic fall of the average price of solar proposed in auctions in the 2013-2019 period. These achievements can be interpreted considering the proposed framework. The success in increasing Brazil’s solar installed capacity and decreasing the average price of solar energy in bidding rounds has been achieved by offering state incentives that have harnessed market forces.
